The aim of this project is to predict the pace of a runner in terms of bpm in order to provide music by the same bpm. To
achieve this, many different models are explored: ARIMA, Naive-Bayes Gaussian Regressor, Ridge Regression, Support Vector
Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Poisson Regressor. In the end, ARIMA is considered the most
appropriate model for this analysis, as it falls under the time dependence method. Under the assumption of independence, the
Gradient Boosted Decision Tree yields the best results in terms of RMSE among all runners and models, although this model
with the data described throughout the report has lower interpretability.
